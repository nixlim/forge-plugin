# Changelog

All notable changes to the Forge plugin are documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Release dates are the UTC dates of the release commits.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Commit-chain replay now preserves receipted history, isolates frozen chains, and supports explicit operator tombstones and frozen aborts.
- Commit-chain ingest now captures every cited evidence file into the run-relative content-addressed store.
- Activated runs now route scope readmission through the typed scope-change builder.
- Scope readmission preserves the current admitted set unless `--replace` is explicit, and containment refusals name escaped pathspecs.
- Run-bound changelog outputs declared by the pinned committed policy are treated as engine-injected gate paths in binding and ingest proofs.
- Revision-9 golden tests now skip with a stated reason on clean checkouts
  where the git-excluded origin-machine run journals cannot exist, instead of
  erroring (found by the CI candidate's binding review).

### Added

- CI: a GitHub Actions workflow running the forge gates on pushes, pull
  requests, and a weekly schedule — full unittest discovery, routing/inventory
  conformance, STRICT evals, and the mechanical drift check in reduced-signal
  CI mode.
- Changelog gate configured in `forge-project.md`: code-class commits require a
  staged changelog entry; docs-class commits are exempt, and archive-only chains
  record a per-chain operator-directed skip until the auto-exemption ships.
- Phase-3 slice 4: the dormant merge verb lifecycle (start/refresh/verify/approve/
  abort/status) with atomic ownership publication and authenticated lineage.
- Phase-3 slice 3: merge candidate/admission, ordered gate, review, and run/task
  adapters (dormant; no `merge start` parser).
- Phase-3 slice 2: event-first chain-family routing and the DM-014 `MergeChainStore`
  with the nine-step transaction, replay repair, and frozen-chain isolation (dormant).
- Phase-3 slice 1: the FR-235 portable common-lock arbiter and `forge common-lock hold`
  long-lived wrapper with the FR-236 start-pipe fence (dormant).
- Spec revision 10: phase-3 authority adjudications — pending-phase-4 result bindings,
  epoch gate plans, post-fetch run-scope abort, normative v2/v4 layouts, the
  one-outstanding-disposition rule, and single-master-package oversized review.

## [0.6.9] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Archive/journal fidelity line: structured `forge-gate-binding/1` verdict bindings,
  chain-evidence embedding in run archives, typed journal builder verbs, batch
  intent/receipt crash recovery, run/task-bound chains with a receipted outbox, and
  the sixteen-proof retrospective `journal ingest-chain`.
- Spec revision 9 and the reason-codes/3 corpus (53 members) with its eval fixture.

### Fixed

- Operator-agent GitHub issues #5 (multi-session legacy journal tolerance, on the
  reporter's committed fixture) and #6.
- Gate-child environment scrub for `FORGE_SESSION_PID` across every stack cell.
- Archive renderer authority ordering and committed-archive preview.
- Legacy pre-revision-9 chain key-set tolerance.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Coordination hardening: successor-DAG retired-scope lifecycle, orphan
  classification, FR-019 append-time record schema, DM-010 stable live session
  identity, and the three-call commit Step 5.
- Spec revision 8 with nineteen new pinned literals.

### Fixed

- Operator-agent GitHub issues #1–#4, each with its reproduction committed as a
  regression test.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Spec revision 7: merge-chain authority (FR-230..FR-243, DM-014..DM-017), the
  forge-cli/2 41-member envelope enum, and bounded lock epochs.

### Fixed

- Reviewer verdict collection real-path handling (`/dev/fd` targets replaced by
  by-name re-opens).
- Assertion-sensor not-applicable short-circuit for docs-only chains.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- CLI phase 1: the `scripts/forge/cli.py` commit-chain state machine
  (FR-210..FR-224, DM-012/DM-013) with staged-diff candidate identity, resumable
  `verify`, two-phase finalize, and the FR-221 dual-accept commit guard pinned by
  the 112-case invocation corpus.
